This repository contains an implementation of Flappy Bird game using Pygame and reinforcement learning with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). The NEAT algorithm is used to train an agent to play Flappy Bird game autonomously by controlling the bird's jumps.

# Requirements
To run the code, the following libraries are required:
1. Pygame
2. NEAT-Python

You can install them using the following command:
~~~
pip install pygame neat-python
~~~
How to run
To run the code, simply execute the file ```game.py``` using Python:

# Demo
Here's a demo of the pre-trained agent playing Flappy Bird:
